# delivery_robot_at_workplace

CSE360 Project
Aurther: Yanqi Liu, Yubo Wang

Our project aims to develop a robot that is in charge of internal delivery in a workplace setting. 
Our robot reaches multiple destinations at a time to deliver mails, packages, coffees to employees across different offices. 
We hope that with such robots employed in the workplace, the efficiency at work would be greatly improved.
